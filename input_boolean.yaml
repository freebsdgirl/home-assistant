# subject to *a lot* of change, rolling out first attempts at an occupancy 
# system. most of the work for this will be happening from within node red,
# but we still need a way to access those values from within home assistant,
# if for no other reason debugging and heatmapping. the input booleans
# defined here simply set if a room is occupied. note that there are some
# rooms defined in home assistant that are *not* defined here, suhc as hallway.
# literally no one occupies a hallway. it's a transient space, so it's outside
# of the scope of occupancy system.

# we are also defining sub-occupancy zones, such as desk and workbench. i'm
# still not sure if this is precisely where this needs to be, since it isi
# a sub-zone of the living room, but they are stil both fairly static areas as
# far as occupancy goes. I think the best approach would be to have these 
# occupancy zones trigger a higher heatmap rating for their parent zone,
# since motion at either of these zones is a good indicator that the 
# occupancy of the room has stronger longevity. this occupancy could also be
# used to trigger an 'on' state for associated devices, but i'd prefer setting
# a very high timeout for defining these spaces as not occupied, thus
# triggering the 'off' state. unlike the parent zones, a timeout does make sense
# for sub-zones.
