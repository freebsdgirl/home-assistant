# this is being used to define heatmap values for occupancy zones. it would
# probably make more sense to create custom sensors with custom attributes but
# i'm fukkin lazy and don't really know how to do that yet. also i think i have
# to use python to do that and python fukkin blows.
#
# because all of the logic for this is happening in node, the heatmap values
# don't technically need to be exposed to home assistant. i'm only doing this
# for debugging reasons.
#
# note that sub-zones do NOT have heatmap values. only parents.
